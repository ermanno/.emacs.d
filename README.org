* Emacs configuration
My personal Emacs configuration.

** Org mode LaTeX configuration

Install ~latex~ and ~dvisvgm~

#+begin_src bash
sudo apt install texlive-latex-base dvisvgm
#+end_src

or

** Anki
Current setup requires to install pandoc: https://pandoc.org/installing.html

** Rust
Install rust-analyzer with:

#+begin_src bash
rustup component add rust-analyzer
#+end_src

Install rust-script (for Org Babel) with:

#+begin_src bash
cargo install rust-script
#+end_src

** TODO TreeSitter issue on Mac

I had the following with Rust, but I have the same problem with Bash, and presumably with other languages as well.

At the moment I have fixed it via the following procedure:

#+begin_src bash
rm ~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter/libtree-sitter-rust.*
#+end_src

Then run:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq treesit-language-source-alist
      '((rust . ("https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-rust" "v0.21.2"))))
#+end_src

And then ~M-x treesit-install-language-grammar~, selecting ~rust~

I am thinking that maybe it makes sense to use the same procedure to install other grammars as well.
